# Interactive Photo Gallery

## this project is a web page "Animal Showcase" that showcases different animals along with their names and countries, with an option to "know more" about each animal.

This project was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the VSCode editor. It provides functionality that can be run in any modern web browser (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc.).

The project is likely a web page showcasing animals with interactive features such as hover effects and potentially clickable "know more" sections for additional details. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and potentially JavaScript for interactive functionality.

* To run HTML and CSS codes in your browser (Whichever is the default browser), you will need to right click in your code editor and select ‘Open live server’ command, this will prompt the code to open in a new window in your browser.

*To run JavaScript code, for the first task ‘arraymap.js’, you will need to open the terminal, change the directory(cd challenges), then type Node+filename(arraymap.js), press ‘Enter’ and you will get the output. For the second task which is also js task, open a new terminal, type Node+filename, press ‘Enter’, and the output will be displayed
